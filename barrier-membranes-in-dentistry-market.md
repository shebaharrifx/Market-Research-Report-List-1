<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes in dentistry are used in guided tissue regeneration and bone regeneration procedures. The market is primarily divided into two types: absorbable membranes and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes, made from materials like collagen, dissolve over time, eliminating the need for a second surgical procedure. Non-absorbable membranes, often made from materials like polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), provide long-term stability but require removal after healing. Both types are critical for enhancing tissue growth and ensuring successful regenerative outcomes in dental surgeries.</p></p>
