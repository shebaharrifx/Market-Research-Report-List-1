<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-consolidating Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Underlayment</li><li>Toppings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-consolidating concrete market is divided into two key types: underlayment and toppings. Underlayment refers to the layer of self-consolidating concrete applied beneath floor finishes, providing a smooth, even surface that reduces labor and enhances durability. Toppings, on the other hand, are decorative or functional layers added on top of existing surfaces, improving aesthetics and wear resistance. Both applications benefit from the material's ability to flow and settle without the need for mechanical vibration, ensuring a high-quality finish.</p></p>
